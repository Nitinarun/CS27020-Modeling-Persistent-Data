# CS27020-Modeling-Persistent-Data-SQL

This folder within my Github is a representation of the types of content I have learnt for my CS27020 Modeling Persistent Data module within my second year. 
The Files on this repository are the practicals that were conducted throughout Semester 1 whereby we had learnt a variety of skills and developed a deeper 
understanding on the following topics within Modeling Persistent Data : 

. Designing and Validating a Database & Learning why to justify the reasoning behind the design
. Implement database design and a range of queries using relational database management systems (RDBMS)
. Access and navigate databases through an appropriate programming interface 
. Explain and provide a rationale for relational, semi-structured and alternative data model concepts.
