Question 1(a): 
<PERSONA>, <TITLE>, <SPEECH>, <LINE>, <SPEAKER> 

Question 1(b):
The difference in the way the Personnae are being stored is in the hamlet.xml file,
the persona tags are open with the descriotion of said persona within the same tag 
whereas in the macbeth.xml & r_and_j.xml files, the persona's are grouped within
<PGROUP> tags and then they have individual <PERSONA> tags for each character name
and a <GRPDESCR> tag to describe the relationship. 

Question 2(a):
/PLAY/ACT/SCENE/SPEECH/LINE
The issue with using using a simple XPath retrieval is that the <STAGEDIR> tags will 
still be shown on the query results.
